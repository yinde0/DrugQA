# Python REST API With Render 

## A fully functional project written in Python to create REST API for drug information retrieval system which is deployed on render

This project aims to provide 
healthcare professionals with quick access to comprehensive information about drugs, 
including side effects, drug classes, activity levels, pregnancy categories, and more. Every part of this project is sample code which shows how to do the following

* Data Preprocessing and Extracting relevant features without extensive feature engineering.
* Transformer architectures, to capture semantic relationships between a prompt sentence and drug name.
* Implement a high-quality RESTful API that seamlessly integrates with the information retrieval model using fastapi.
* Implementation of API usage and request/response formats.

## How to replicate this project

The easiest was is to go through the notebooks 

1. clone this project
2. install all dependencies in the requirement.txt
3. run `uvicorn main:app --reload` inside DrugQA directory.
4. Create a free account on <a href="https://render.com/" target="_blank">render</a>
5. Push your codes to github 
6. Connect your github to render, and deploy.

## Issues you might encounter
1. The model is quite large which might cause the inference time to increase, further work would be done to resolve this.
